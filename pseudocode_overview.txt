DATA ENTRY
interface to add additional information to the data base
1. list of PDB file names
2. new flavin key
3. chemical properties

adding new PDB file names will call the following process:
1. compare against list of PDB file names already in the DB so we avoid duplicates
2. for the subset of new files:
	a. for each flavin in the PDB:
		i. assign a unique ID
		ii. for each of the 18 atoms of the isoalloxazine, create a listof the atoms that interact with this it
		iii. push new flavin to the DB
3. update the list of PDB files in the database.


DATA BASE
1. list of PDB file names whose flavins are in the DB
2. list of flavin keys
3. flavin structures captured as follows:
	a. unique ID representing PDB file and flavin w/in the file
	b. 18 x ? array of atoms close to the isoalloxazine
4. additional chemical properties 
	a. listed with unique flavin ID
	b. format more ambigous for now


CLUSTERING QUERY
input: key atoms of interest:
plot the flavins by the list of atoms interacting with these key elements, return statistics on known chemical properties by these clusers
input: chemical properties of interest:
